# better-business-logic-with-typescript
The repository will provide examples on how to use and implement design patterns (like Composite, Builder, Template Method and others) using Typescript. The repository will demonstrate code reuse strategies and extensibility techniques for building robust Angular Services and Business Logic.  The repository will demonstrate how to implement shared Angular services and how to use them in Angular domain services. The services will include rich business logic layers that use the angular-rules-engine and angular-actions NPM packages.
